Create a comprehensive test plan that will verify the implementation matches the specs at `notes/specs.md`

### Step 1: Identify Test Scenarios

Based on the specs:

- Happy path flows
- Error conditions
- Edge cases
- State transitions
- Responsive behavior
- Accessibility requirements

### Step 2: Create Test Cases

For each scenario, create detailed test cases:

```markdown
### TC-NNN: [Test Name]

**Description:** [What this test verifies]

**Preconditions:**

- [Required state before test]
- [Required data]

**Steps:**

| Step | Action           | Expected Result      |
| ---- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| 1    | [Action to take] | [What should happen] |
| 2    | [Action to take] | [What should happen] |

**Test Data:**

- Field 1: `value`
- Field 2: `value`

**Expected Outcome:** [Final verification]

**Priority:** Critical / High / Medium / Low
```

### Step 3: Organize by Category

Group test cases:

- Functional tests
- UI/UX tests
- Validation tests
- Integration tests (if applicable)
- Edge case tests

### Step 4: Create Status Tracker

```markdown
## Status Tracker

| TC     | Test Case | Priority | Status | Remarks |
| ------ | --------- | -------- | ------ | ------- |
| TC-001 | [Name]    | High     | [ ]    |         |
| TC-002 | [Name]    | Medium   | [ ]    |         |
```

### Step 5: Add Known Issues Section

```markdown
## Known Issues

| Issue | Description | TC Affected | Steps to Reproduce | Severity |
| ----- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------------ | -------- |
|       |             |             |                    |          |
```

## Output

Save the test plan to: `notes/test_plan.md`

Include:

1. Overview and objectives
2. Prerequisites
3. Reference wireframe (if applicable)
4. Test cases (10-20 typically)
5. Status tracker
6. Known issues section

## Test Case Guidelines

- Each test should be independent
- Use specific, concrete test data
- Include both positive and negative tests
- Cover all screens from wireframe (if applicable)
- Test all states from prototype
- Consider mobile/responsive

## Do NOT

- Over-test obvious functionality
- Skip error handling tests
- Forget accessibility basics
