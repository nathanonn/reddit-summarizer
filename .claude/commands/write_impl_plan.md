Specs is approved, test plan is ready. Now we need an implementation plan.

- **Specs**: `notes/specs.md`
- **Test Plan:** `notes/test_plan.md`

## Your Task

Create a detailed implementation plan that maps to the test cases.

### Step 1: Analyze Test Cases

For each test case (TC-NNN):

- What functionality must exist?
- What files need to be created/modified?
- What dependencies are needed?

### Step 2: Create Task Breakdown

Group test cases into implementation tasks:

```markdown
## Implementation Plan: [PHRASE_NAME]

### Overview

[Brief description]

### Files to Create/Modify

[List all files]

### Implementation Tasks

#### Task 1: [Name]

**Mapped Test Cases:** TC-001, TC-002, TC-003
**Files:**

- `path/to/file1.php` - [description]
- `path/to/file2.js` - [description]

**Implementation Notes:**

- [Key detail 1]
- [Key detail 2]

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] TC-001 passes
- [ ] TC-002 passes
- [ ] TC-003 passes

#### Task 2: [Name]

...
```

### Step 3: Identify Dependencies

- What from previous phrases is needed?
- What order should tasks be implemented?
- Any external dependencies?

### Step 4: Estimate Complexity

- Simple: 1-2 tasks, straightforward
- Medium: 3-5 tasks, some complexity
- Complex: 6+ tasks, significant work

## Output

Save the implementation plan to: `notes/impl_plan.md`

Include:

1. Overview
2. Files to create/modify
3. Tasks with TC mappings
4. Dependencies
5. Complexity estimate

## Guidelines

- Every test case must map to a task
- Tasks should be completable in one session
- Include enough detail to guide implementation
- Reference design system patterns

## Do NOT

- Include actual code (next step)
- Over-engineer simple features
